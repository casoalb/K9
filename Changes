-------------------------
[*] Added ping timeout detection. Made changes in Makefile, main.c, extern.h, messages.c,
    and ping.c.
[*] Changed the log routine to implement log rotation. Also, for better organization, files
    will be kept in a separate log directory. For the time being, removal of old logs will
    be manually done. In the event that K9 becomes stable enough, a remove_logfile routine
    may be added. Altered log.c only.





k9.c:   p[MASKLEN] = 0;
k9.c:   p[MASKLEN] = '\0';
