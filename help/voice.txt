HELP:
This command gives channel voice priviledges to the
specified user.
If the channel is moderated (+m) only voiced users (+)
and Op's (@) can chat.
If the User in question is already Voiced but it isn't
shown, if you try to voice him again, k9 will devoice him.

This command acts as a Voice/Devoicer.
