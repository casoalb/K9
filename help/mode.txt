SYNTAX:
k9 mode #channelname <+/-MODES>
-
HELP:
This command set the modes for the given channel and
put them into the database.
For more Info, check k9 help guardm to see how to
guard modes.
if modes are guarded, only k9 can change them with
the current command.

EXAMPLE:
k9 mode #australia +nt
-
Sometimes the modes are present in the channel and
they are not shown. If this happens for example in
the channel #australia, do the following:
K9 mode #australia -nt
k9 mode #australia +nt
They will become visible after these two commands :c)
