SYNTAX: /msg k9 auth #channelname <password>

HELP:
This command is used to validate yourself on k9 (only if
you have been added before and assigned a valid password).
Everytime k9 goes on a Netsplit (when servers break
connection) you must issue this command again in order
to identify yourself to regain access.
This is required before any commands with level larger
than 0 can be used.
