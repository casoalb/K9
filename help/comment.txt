HELP:
Sets the Message K9 Will say when you join a Channel.
If you wish for k9 to perform an action when you enter
a channel then type the Syntax below:
k9 comment #channelname $ACT <action you want>
-
Also K9 Can Play a Sound file when you enter and
also state a Comment about it at the same time.
The Syntax for that is below:
k9 comment #channelname $SND <wavefile.wav> <Message>
-
Please remember the $SND and $ACT Commands are CASE
SENSITIVE.
-
A wild card $NICK can be used anywhere in the
comment message and k9 will use your current nick.
