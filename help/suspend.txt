SYNTAX:
k9 suspend #channelname <UserID> <SuspensionLEVEL>
-
HELP:
suspend Demotes the user to a given level but does
not remove the original level.
If a user is level 400 and you suspend his mode to 200
then the users effective level is only 200. He cannot use

commands higher then his suspension level.
This allows you to reduce access and still have k9
remember the original access level.
-
EXAMPLE:
Lets suppose you have a user with 499 access Level
and you want to suspend him to 200.
No one with more access then 200 can touch that user
(remove him, moduser him).
Only you will be able to do that since he is still
registed at level 499 !
